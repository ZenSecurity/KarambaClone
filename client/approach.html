                <h3>The Risks of the<br>
                    Connected Cars</h3>
                <p>As cars become ‘smarter’ and connect to the Internet through cellular wireless networks, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, they also become vulnerable to cyber attacks. Modern vehicles have over 100 controllers, or Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that are responsible for running most of the car’s functions, such as the steering wheel, engine, braking system, airbags, and navigation systems. Like any other externally connected computers, ECUs in connected cars have become targets for hackers.</p>
                
                <h4>A Hacker’s Way into the Car: Externally Connected ECUs</h4>
                <p>To pull off a successful attack, hackers first need to find a way into the car’s Controller Area Network (CAN Bus). While there are over a hundred ECUs connected to the CAN Bus, only a few are open externally.</p>
                <p>These external ECUs are the gates into the car. Detect and stop attackers at these gates, and the risk of attacks penetrating the car’s network, to disrupt its safe operations, is significantly reduced.</p>

                <h3>Karamba’s ECU Endpoint Security:<br>
                    Dropper Detection and Malware Prevention</h3>

                <h4>Karamba-generated Factory Settings Policy</h4>
                <p>Karamba’s unique endpoint security protects externally connected ECUs from attacks. Karamba enables ECU and system providers to define factory settings for each ECU, generating a policy that creates whitelists of all ECU’s permitted program binaries, processes, scripts, network behavior, etc. This policy is embedded within the externally connected ECU to ensure only explicitly allowed code and behavior may run on it.</p>

                <h4>Early Detection of Droppers</h4>
                <p>Karamba identifies any attacks that attempt to download and run on the ECU.  Typically, when hackers target a system, they will use a ‘Dropper’, which is a small piece of code or operation, to try to exploit a vulnerability and implant malware. The malware is the code that ultimately tampers with or takes control of the function of the car, which can cause significant damage and put the safety of the driver and others on the road at risk.</p>
                <p>Karamba detects the unexpected behavior or operation of a Dropper and immediately alerts on the attack attempt. The early warning gives the car’s original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and system providers time to address the threat. Karamba’s alert includes the complete trail of the attack on the ECU, including its source and path, so vulnerabilities can be fixed and blocked to prevent any malware from infiltrating the CAN Bus.</p>

                <h4>Malware Prevention</h4>
                <p>The moment a Dropper attempts to introduce malware on an externally connected ECU, Karamba will detect it as foreign code and block it when it attempts to run. If it’s not part of the factory settings, it is not allowed to run; if it’s not allowed to run, it can’t do anything to disrupt the car’s safe operations.</p>

                <h3>Benefits:</h3>

The solution is embedded in the development cycles of the controller; only when the controller is updated, Karamba is updated to reflect the new factory settings.  Regardless of changes in the threat landscape, the version of the ECU in use in the car is protected.

                            <b>Requires Only a Short Quality Check</b> — Karamba’s software is part of the ECU software. When embedding Karamba into a car, only the system that runs Karamba (e.g. the infotainment) should be checked if it performs according to its specifications. No need to test the entire car.

                <h3>Retrofit<br>
                    Now</h3>
                <p>All recent attacks were performed on models that are already on the road. <a href="http://www.ic3.gov/media/2016/160317.aspx">The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) issued a public safety announcement</a>, warning that automobiles are increasingly vulnerable to exploits from cyber attackers.</p>
                <p class="last-p">By adding Karamba to the software versions of externally connected ECUs, the car industry can protect existing models against hackers. Karamba can be added as part of the regular software updates that drivers receive during regular maintenance and service checks. Once deployed, externally connected ECUs protected by Karamba will be hardened against the cyber threats targeting them.</p>
