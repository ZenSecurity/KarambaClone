                <h3>Why did you found Karamba Security?</h3>
                <p>As the FBI recently
                    <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/technology-35841571">warned</a>, cars are becoming targets for hackers.</p>
                <p>With our background in endpoint security, we saw an opportunity to provide the automotive industry a completely hardened
                    solution that could keep drivers safe from cyber attacks.</p>

                <h3>What about the co-founders made this company the right company? </h3>
                <p>The co-founders, Ami Dotan, David Barzilai, Tal Ben David and Assaf Harel have extensive experience building innovative
                    technologies and successful companies. Tal and Assaf bring direct cybersecurity expertise, from their days managing
                    Check Point's endpoint security research and development teams. Ami and David bring entrepreneurial and business prowess —
                    Ami has backed six IPOs, two of which exceeded a valuation of $1.5B and $2B, and 4 mergers, totaling $450M in aggregate;
                    while David was part of the management teams responsible for two mergers and acquisitions of $250M in aggregate.</p>

                <h3>What problem in the market do you solve?</h3>
                <p>Karamba addresses the automotive industry's need to protect the safety of connected cars against cyberattacks.
                    In recent months, we have seen the Jeep Cherokee, Toyota Prius, Tesla Model S, Nissan Leaf and other cars
                    <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/10/five-car-hacking-lessons-we-learned-this-summer/">successfully attacked by white hat attackers</a>.
                    Exploits ranged from turning on the radio to killing the car's engine as it drove on the freeway!
                    In response to the Jeep hack,
                    <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2952186/mobile-security/chrysler-recalls-14m-vehicles-after-jeep-hack.html">Chrysler recalled 1.4 million vehicles</a>.
                    With Karamba, automotive vendors can protect the externally connected devices in their vehicles, locking down the
                    Electronic Control Units (ECUs) to immediately detect attack attempts and keep the car safe from any type of exploit or
                    malware that could compromise its safe operation.</p>

                <h3>4.	How big is this problem?</h3>
                <p>Analysts estimated that 20% of vehicles sold worldwide in 2015 would include some form of embedded connectivity.
                    Gartner predicts that by 2020, the number of connected cars sold globally will be 250 million.
                    This represents a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 45%, which is 10x the CAGR of the traditional automotive industry.</p>
                <p>PricewaterhouseCoopers and Booz & Allen predict that by 2020, the safety technologies category within the connected cars
                    market will reach $41 billion in sales, with a CAGR of 28%. The entire internet of things (IoT) security market is predicted to reach $120B by 2020.</p>

                <h3>How do you solve it?</h3>
                <p>Karamba has purpose-built a solution that hardens the externally connected controllers within an automobile against hackers.
                    Typically, these controllers manage the telematics (sensors, instrumentation, navigation, etc.),
                    infotainment (radio, head unit, etc.) and on-board diagnostics (OBD) of the vehicle. Karamba ensures only valid code and
                    valid behaviors are allowed to run on the controllers to keep the car safe and prevent the attacks from ever infiltrating
                    the car's Controller Area Network (CAN Bus).</p>

                <h3>What do you mean by "block hackers at the gate"?</h3>
                <p>Karamba focuses on hardening the controllers within the car that are open to external access (via the Internet, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.).
                    These are the controllers that hackers can use to get into the car's CAN Bus and launch their attack, making them, in essence,
                    the gates to the car. Karamba stops the attacks on the controller to ‘block hackers at the gate.'
                    As a result, the attacks never make it inside, never reach the CAN Bus, and never have access to any of the internal ECUs that control the car's functions.</p>

                <h3>What makes your solution unique vs. other in-car security companies?</h3>
                <p>Rather than looking for hackers that are already in the car's internal network (a.k.a. CAN Bus),
                    Karamba is focused on detecting and stopping an attack from getting into the CAN Bus in the first place.
                    Karamba's end-point solution has been purpose-built to protect the externally connected controllers of the car.
                    This approach provides early detection of threats targeting the vehicle and complete malware prevention to ensure the
                    ongoing integrity of the car's operations.</p>

                <h3>What are the benefits of your Controller Hardening approach?</h3>

                            Karamba is updated to reflect the new factory settings. Regardless of changes in the threat landscape,
                            the version of the ECU in use in the car is protected.

                            according to its specifications. There is no need to test the entire car.

                        </span>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Who are your target customers? </h3>
                <p>Karamba's solutions are designed to help car companies and tier-1 system providers, who build the car's externally
                    connected controllers, keep drivers safe from hackers.</p>
                <p>Car companies don't want to tarnish their reputation, incur the costs of recalls, or lose future sales as the result
                    of their vehicles being compromised. Tier-1 vendors also have their reputation and revenues to uphold; they are held
                    accountable if the car is penetrated via their system. Both need a way to harden the controllers against attacks to
                    ensure they cannot be used to get in and compromise the safety of the cars' drivers and passengers. </p>

                <h3>Can your approach be integrated with existing car models, on the road?</h3>
                <p>Yes, the solution can be used to protect both new and existing car models. Automobile manufacturers can retrofit the cars
                    on the road now, as part of the ECU software update, whenever the car comes into the dealer for regular maintenance.</p>

                <h3>How much money have you raised? Who were the investors?</h3>
                <p>We received $2.5M in seed funding from YL Ventures, which invests $10M along the lifecycle of its portfolio companies,
                    and GlenRock, Leon Recanati's private investment company, which is an early investor in Mobileye, a car-industry company,
                    with over $7B in market cap, among other unicorn companies.</p>

                <h3>Where is the company based?</h3>
                <p class="last-p">The company's research and development is based in Israel, with business development located in Detroit, Michigan.</p>
