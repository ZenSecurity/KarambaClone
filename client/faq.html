                        infotainment (radio, head unit, etc.) and on-board diagnostics (OBD) of the vehicle. Karamba ensures only valid code and

                        the car’s Controller Area Network (CAN Bus).</p>

                        the gates to the car. Karamba stops the attacks on the controller to ‘block hackers at the gate.’
                        As a result, the attacks never make it inside, never reach the CAN Bus, and never have access to any of the internal ECUs that control the car’s functions.</p>
